        <h2>Why Do I Need to Sign In?</h2>
        <p>
            This lets us know that you're in the Olin Community. We'll show you
            Olin community events, and we'll trust you to add and edit calendar
            events.
        </p>
        <p>
            You don't need to sign in: if you're on campus; if this browser
            visited ABE recently from on campus; or, to view only public events.
        </p>

        <h2>Privacy</h2>
        <p>Here's what we currently store about you:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>On your computer</dt>
            <dd>
                That you're authorized to view and edit events. Your email
                address. (But this is only used to check whether you have
                administrative access â€” it's not stored on the server.)

            <dd>How many people tried different things, and when. But not
            who. We use this to figure out what's worth keeping, and what
            to work on.</dd>
